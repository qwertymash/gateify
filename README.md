yea honestly i got no clue lmao, this is my first ever scp sl plugin<br>
ignore .gitignore and .gitattributes visual studio just added so much to it i dont even understand a single thing in it üò≠<br>

ever saw some sweats escape the facility and it dictates the entire match? have you seen scps stuck on surface and camp the surface all the damn time after the nuke finally goes and the round never ends (future plugin btw!!!)? are you fed up with it?
if you said yes to any of these, you finally found the solution (please dont sue me)

so basically what it does is lock the gates and open them once a respawn wave arrived:
- gate a for chaos
- gate b for mtf

"THATS SUCH A BAD IDEA! THE FACILITY WILL BECOME A DEATH TRAP!"
i hear you, and to that i say "ummmm kills you"

i mean who doesnt love a tiiiiny bit more of a massacre? (i do)

roadmap:
- try to fix the glitchy message not showing translation
- maybe make it so every gate can have each owns config (and not the same for both)
